    <h2>Recipe Prepraration</h2>

    <p>

        We can make these nachos from scratch using common uitilities of the kitchen.

    </p>

    <h2>Preparing the Nachos</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>First, cut the Masienda Tortillas into nacho chip shapes, typically cutting them into quarters.</li>

        <li>Dry the cut tortillas in a low oven, at 200 degrees for 10 minutes.  Tip: flip the chips halfway through for the most dryness.</li>

        <li>Depending on how many chips you are making, you will need to fry them in a gallon of canola oil at 350 degrees fahrenheit for 1-2 minutes. 
		
			Tip: The cut tortillas has very little natural flavor, making the oil used to fry them reusable.</li>

        <li>After cooking, while the chips are removed from the oil and still darknening, season with a reasonable amont of kosher salt.</li>

        <li>Let the fried chips dry over a paper towel on a pan until cool enough to eat.</li>

    </ul>
